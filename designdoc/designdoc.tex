\section*{Problem statement and requirements}
The task of this project is to implement the \textbf{control\_system} of the provided quadcopter simulation. The \textbf{control\_system} get measurement values from the quadcopter model as input and should provide PWM commands for the motors of the quadcopter as output, such that the quadcopter:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item does not crash on the ground or with an obstacle
	\item pass through all the waypoints
	\item finally reaches the target position
\end{enumerate}
The side condition is that condition 2) and 3) should be achieved as fast as possible. At the start of the simulation the quadcopter is placed to a fixed starting position.
\vspace{0.2cm}\\
The measurement inputs of the \textbf{control\_system} include data from:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a 3-axis gyroscope
	\item a 3-axis accelerometer
	\item latitude, longitude and altitude values from a GPS sensor
	\item a sonar based distance sensor that points to the bottom of the quadcopter
\end{itemize}
The GPS sensor provide new data ever 200 ms, the sonar sensor every 100ms. The update frequency of the gyroscope and accelerometer is a lot higher (maybe add exact value here).
\vspace{0.2cm}\\
A PI-controller is provided that takes absolute pitch, roll and yaw-differences values and controls the pose of the quadcopter accordingly by generating the PWM signals for the motors. \\
To accomplish this, the PI-controller needs the current pose of the quadcopter, thus this pose is an additional measurement that is provided to the \textbf{control\_system}. \\
So the task of this project includes building a \emph{state estimator} for the pose of the quadcopter based on the given measurement, i.e. this additional measurement of the pose needs to be replaced by a estimated pose based on the given measurements.
